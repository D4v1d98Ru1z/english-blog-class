The activities that make me happy are skating, walking in nature, dancing and swimming. I like to walking because it reduces the stress of a monotonous day, when I am leaving the university. I walk around in that area of the public transport.

Dancing is one of the funniest activities, I can dance in groups or even alone at parties. Swimming is a funny activity and it is an exercise for the whole body that provides both strength and aerobic exercise. Swimming is a convenient way when we are young people.

Camping is one of the activities that I am most in charge of, and this is one of my favorite hobbies. I like being in nature, I would like to rest physically and mentally in addition to reduce stress and worries.
But ... happiness is also having positive thoughts, that's right, this is also an activity of the human being in which we can be happy. There are a number of activities that have been shown to increase happiness, some of them even prevent the brain from falling into the hedonistic adaptation.

Expressing gratitude, that is, being grateful helps improve our level of well-being and improves our self-esteem; It makes us aware of all the good things that surround us. A good thought would also be to cultivate optimism as it directly affects our way of seeing life and makes us feel encouraged about the future and fight with perseverance for our dreams. This type of activities help the mental well-being of the human being.
