# Colombian food

Colombia is currently one of the most recognized countries in the world, for its culture, its events, its traditions, its ecosystems and especially for the gastronomic diversity; in each of the regions that are the case, the recipes are usually typical of cities or areas of the country, it is also common to incorporate other ingredients and other methods into these traditions.
To talk about the Colombian gastronomyâ€™s history, we have to take into account its beginning, it was before the colonial age, when people of native communities had to feed mainly on fruit crops and hunting certain animals, especially birds.
When talking about colonial age, after a lot of researches, people realized our food was creole because it is a mixture of different ethnic groups which populated our territory, those were African and indigenous. The first contributions to Colombian food bases came from indigenous which had potatoes, ahuyama, cubios, chuguas, cassava, arracacha, corn and be like, with Spaniards contributions such sugar, carrot, wheat, meats from chicken, cow, goat, sea animals, also tropical fruits, different cooking and frying techniques were involved to create a new gastronomic identity.
The best known recipes are the sancocho, the arepa, the Paisa tray, ajiaco, suckling pig, mute, tamal.
Finally, we conclude that currently Colombia, is a trend for these great characteristics that have been forming during all this time, highlighted as well, that the new generations of chefs are triumphing internationally thanks to all the change that was obtained at the time of colonization.
