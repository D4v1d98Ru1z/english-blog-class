These two are considered cultures or for other routines. Normally they are for young
people. If you like to read, listen to classical music, dance, painting or theater, you
are probably a culture vulture; but if on the contrary, you like to go out dancing,
drinking, being with friends, or going to bars, you are an animal party. They are two
very different and totally opposite cultures.

The vulture culture is passionate about art, they visit galleries, exhibitions, and
museums. For the music, they attend concerts in large theaters, to listen to
symphony orchestras, philharmonic orchestras, chamber groups, ensembles,
quintets, quartets, duets, among others. They admire dance a lot because that is a
pure expression of the body, they like the natural, the delicacy of the human body;
like contemporary dance or ballet.

Party animals are people who, on the contrary, lead a crazy life. They usually go to
parties, they have a very broad social life. They love to listen to music at full volume,
they like to drink alcohol and go out a lot.

Now, what kind of routine do you have? Do you like to read or do you prefer to go
out with friends? Would you rather go to a big concert in your city park or better go
to a quiet concert with a foreign symphony orchestra? Do you like to go to the movies
or dance? Do you like painting and sculptures or do you like to drink? Do you listen
to David Getta or Tchaikovsky?

The tastes of each person are different. These create the essence of each one. And
although these cultures are a bit extreme, in reality, we all have something of culture
vulture and party animal. Our behaviors are very variable. Each of them is
respectable, because without them things they would not be the same. Devourers of
culture are just as necessary to party devourers.

This is a free expression, likewise, it should be accepted by everyone. It has very
own and clear qualities. It covers the world and the forms of the different forms, since
art is not the same in the whole world nor the festivals.
