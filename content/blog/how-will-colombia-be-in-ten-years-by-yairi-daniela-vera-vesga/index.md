# How will Colombia be in ten years?

Colombia is the country of the pleasant heart, where everything happens and nothing happens, basically it is a submissive state, which is manipulated by the oligarchies, where power is used for their own benefit and rarely for the people. emphasizing the achievements that have been achieved in recent years in Colombia have advanced in different aspects like: Technology, agro-industry and peace processes, thanks to the efforts of the government, although they have been minimal in the development of this great nation, but however, it is a country where the population is afraid, since to manifest their disagreements has been taken as an act of rebellion and violence against the state, and in this way the citizenship does not feel protected as the function should be with respect of people.

Hope in Colombia is the only thing that makes us keep faith and love for this land full of humble and hardworking people, that is why in this great nation they have a plan how they will govern each period, in addition to this, they make predictions in the long term, I mean, just as it is done in the soccer world cup, where the result matters but everyone bets that Colombia will win. For the next ten years, the objectives are framed in four relevant aspects, such as social investment, environment, post-conflict and agro-industry. Which aim to provide better living conditions for citizens especially those who have been marginalized and a discriminate socially.

In terms of social investment, education is a fundamental aspect to eradicate poverty rates and providing opportunities for people to have a better quality of life, and so help reduce homicide rates unemployment, malnutrition and among others. This is a job that requires mutual collaboration, a change of conscience and, above all, policies that guarantee or promise society health, housing and education that dignify the life of every human being.

In the second aspect to work is the post-conflict, which is the next stage of a peace agreement signed by the government, the citizenry and the FARC, is the process of social reintegration of ex-combatants, it is also the process of compensation to the victims, especially to clarify the truth and find forgiveness, through this agreement you can reach the populations that have been separated for the conflict armed, such as Vichada, Vaupes, Putumayo, Guain√≠a, Guaviare, Meta, Arauca and among others and in another way it will be possible to invest in roads, technology, communication, education, health and basic needs. This aspect goes hand in hand with the environment, since these regions have great diversity in resources (fauna, flora, water sources and very nutrient-rich soils), because of conflicts it makes it possible to make use of these territories for their use and so will promote tourism, research and new economic models, as well as the eradication of illicit crops.

Finalizing is the issue of agro-industry, which is a government goal to make use of land and generate a more stable economy that allows connect knowledge, technology and science in a very broad field to produce food in a more efficient way adapting to the climatic changes that are approaching, in addition to the increase of the population, this is a measure to avoid that the economy of the country depends solely on the extraction of petroleum, and the mining

These approaches and aspect for the coming years will allow an increase in the economy, a better use of natural resources and better guarantees or promise  for citizens in education, employment and living conditions, where large cities have an obligation to ensure security and safety. Investment of resources in an appropriate way, breaking with the inheritance of corrupt politicians and drones and the duty of citizens is to ensure that each territory is respected and fulfill their rights and duties to turn the illusion of a better Colombia into a reality.
