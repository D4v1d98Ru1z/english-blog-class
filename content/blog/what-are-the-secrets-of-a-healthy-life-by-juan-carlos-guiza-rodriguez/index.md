One believes that to have a healthy life you must do only exercise and now, but this is not the case, there are many factors involved, I set about looking for a healthy life and I found many things that I thought were not important, but they are.

In the articles I read, they show what habits one must adapt to "have a healthy life", these are:

- Sleep well
- To have a good diet
- Exercise
- Eliminate stress
- Use sunblock
- Have a positive perspective
- Nourish social relationships
- Find whom to love
- Have fun limiting alcohol consumption
- Take a break

That is why I take the task of describing the most important of each one.

- Get enough sleep

Sleeping well helps us to be alert throughout the day, helps us feel more energized and healthier.

The reduction of sleep hours can lead to premature death and deteriorate our cognitive abilities, so we must sleep enough, for an adult, the hours of sleep are about 8 hours and for a child are approximately 12 hours according to BBC NEWS.

- Good diet

People do not eat well or do not have a good diet since feeding depends on the time that people can have in their lives.

Since if they have a chaotic life where they do not have time almost for anything, their food would only depend on fast-prepared meals, a global example would be fast foods or junk foods.

Meals and the times that should be provided:

low-salt foods, sugars, preservatives, additives, etc. And the times would be from 5 to 8 daily meals, understood as meals; small portions, so that the body can make the most of the nutrients and minerals that these foods have, because if a lot of food is eaten, the organism may become saturated and collateral effects may occur, such as Sleep, Laziness, Tiredness, etc.

That is why it is important to feed in a good way since food is the fuel of the body.

- Exercise

Exercise helps keep the body and mind healthy, this must be a commitment, since people when they want to make drastic changes end up fleeing.

Exercise prevents the body from having a sedentary life, since having a life in that way causes the body to become rigid and start to fail at some point; in a few words, the body is deteriorating and contracting diseases more easily.

- Have a positive life perspective

Having a positive life perspective helps us not to be sad or disappointed about "life" since if we are with a negative mentality it can lead us to create psychological and even physical problems.

- Nourish social relationships

In life, we surround ourselves with all kind of people and there are times, it is better to be alone, but having a friendship or a healthy social life helps us to be in good spirits and thus have a better quality of life.

- Find whom to love

When we find that person that completes us, that fills us and helps us to be better people, it makes us feel good with ourselves and with that person. This to generate positive emotions that help make the mind feel stupefied and healthy.

- Have fun limit alcohol consumption

We all know that taking too much alcohol is harmful to health, but in small quantities, it helps our body to function well, for example, beer helps to cleanse the kidneys.

- Take a break

Taking time out helps us to rest from the life we lead and to give ourselves some time to recover.
