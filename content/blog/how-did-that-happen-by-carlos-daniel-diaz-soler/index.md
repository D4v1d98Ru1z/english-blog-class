spoiler: The human being always has uncertainty, mystery, unknowns about facts that have passed and maybe can occur, no matter their relation or connection with these, that is to say, the main reason is  the nature human, because we want to investigate, analyze or speculate about to the different events that occurred in our proper life or events that happened around world, and perhaps would rewrite  the human history.

The human being always has uncertainty, mystery, unknowns about facts that have passed and maybe can occur, no matter their relation or connection with these, that is to say, the main reason is  the nature human, because we want to investigate, analyze or speculate about to the different events that occurred in our proper life or events that happened around world, and perhaps would rewrite  the human history. 

Considering these, for example when people have some problems in which they don’t know how it happened, we always look for guilty, hypothesis or different theories about this specific problem; so, we should be cleaner, focus on, understand and looking for a solution for this problems, so that it doesn’t happen again in the future.

But in some cases, we think in a question about if could we really predicted, and have under control everything that happens? But somewhat we wish to have everything under control, and we would like to achieve this, although many people have different opinions about that, because they say that life would be lost the meaning, and would always have the same course, we wouldn’t have emotions or surprises; But this is valid? The truth is that having the control of things would be boring, but maybe if we implement this theory in other aspects?

In the history of mankind had occurred goods and bad events which had changed the course of society, this has been essential because this we help us to improve, progress and grow as a better society, however, exist other cases in which we wish, that it’s not to happen again or maybe that we may be predicted this, because these factors gave us death, catastrophes, illnesses, fears, sadness and different problems unexplained that torture us and generate shivers and nightmares to the society.

The most important facts we can remember were: World Wars, Civil wars, natural disasters, terrorist attack, kidnappings, attacks on the environment, assassination, among others, many of these situations have been because of the human being, we don't know how to control and overcome the problems that occur every day in society, and these  problems seem haven’t solved, in this way we can justify that people aren’t aware to improve the different aspects, but the important now is improve and  if we do this,  doesn’t happen again the same events that generated horror; But the reality  that we are living is another, this is a vicious circle in which we can’t go out of there, and we always worsen everything.

However, in some cases, the human being is not guilty of catastrophes that occur like: Earthquakes, tsunamis. Tornados, volcanic eruptions, at that specific moment perhaps we would like to know that it will happen so to warn or alert and maybe not suffer the terrible consequences.

In conclusion, life is a surprise that daily we must confront that, but these surprises could be prevented or anticipated, how can we do that? The idea is to progress together, this only of this way, we may be able to say how the events could happen instead of saying “how it happened?” and what consequences it left us.
