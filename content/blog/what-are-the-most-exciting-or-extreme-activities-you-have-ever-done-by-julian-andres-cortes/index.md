The most extreme experience that I have lived was on a trip that I made to a park which within its attractions was that of boating, I had always wanted to practice this sport because I really like to see extreme sports and within them was The canoeing in river of high current, I decided to realize the route and to live this extreme experience.

To carry out the tour the instructor explained the rules that we had to comply with and the security elements that we should use in case of falling to the river, for this sport you need a waterproof vest, an oar, a rope, a helmet.

The river in which I lived this experience was not so aggressive its current, however I could experience in several stretches of the river a high current which was trying to turn the kayak and that the person lost control of the paddle, I realized that for This sport takes a lot of effort because with the paddle we push the kayak and also give direction and due to the strong currents of the water because you need to have a lot of strength in the arms to keep the kayak in the direction you want, also You need to have balance because the high currents also make the kayak try to turn and you need balance to stay in the kayak and not turn around
It was an incredible experience that I lived to be able to fulfill my dream of sailing in a river practicing this sport.

Also practice this sport in calm water and it is much easier to maneuver the kayak because it has no current, also make the crossing by a river but it was calmer and making a comparison between the river with high current and low, I prefer the high due to the fact that from the beginning of the tour an incredible adventure is experienced trying to handle the kayak, to use the current to go faster trying to stay in the kayak and competing with the other members to see who arrives in the first place without falling or lose control of the kayak

The experience I experienced in this park was impressive because there were many people wanting to live and the experience that I was living and practicing this sport requires a lot of effort and for this reason I wanted to practice it and measure the skills I had to control The kayak, I realized that it is very difficult to control the kayak when there is too much current because the kayak tends to turn in different directions and it is difficult to manage or keep it in one direction.
Conduct a competition with my family and other visitors who were practicing this sport, at the start of the competition many of the members began to paddle hard in order to go ahead of the others, but the current of the water prevented them from controlling the kayak and they ended up falling or the kayak crashed against the edges of the river. 

There are some competitions that perform different teams and consists of the descent by rivers of a lot of water and within them there are rapids and the competing athletes have great strength and can control the kayak so that they can get out of these fast and easily. do not crash or fall from their kayaks, besides this is a competition that develops at high speed and there is very little time to react for which these athletes are very precise


I went to an intermediate step and I did not fall as many times as the other competitors and managed to get out of the rapids more easily than the others and manage to stay in the first place and beat the other participants who were with me
