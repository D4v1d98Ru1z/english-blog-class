# Bogot치 a city of leisure?

Bogota is a great city that has 8million inhabitants, of which a large number are young, many study, others work, some do both, and others are considered "Nini" "neither study nor works, (ni estudia ni trabaja) in Spanish. 

In spite of this, all the young people carry out different activities on a daily basis in their free time, some do sports, while others prefer to stay at home to watch television. But it will be that the activities that these young people to serve in some way for their personal growth or they simply dedicate themselves to do "funny" things
According to a study carried out by the urban culture observatory, it is pointed out that "the strong relationship young people have with almost all kinds of cultural affairs, especially public activities, is remarkable. However, adds the researcher, there is a fairly high tendency to remain in the family, using mass communication devices."

Although a large part of young people are enjoying this type of activity, many young people enjoy staying at home playing video games, watching movies or television, reading books, although in smaller numbers and it has been shown that Bogot치 is a city that does not read, that the surveys carried out show results such as that 52% answered not having read a book a year ago.

the most carried out activities by young people are going out to party with friends, going to concerts or bars and this is not a secret for anyone, also to increase the practice of any sport or just go to the gym lasts the last years, for example, the use of bicycles has been encrusted in an expository manner in the city of Bogot치, which is even considered the capital of the bike today. It should be clear that I am very much in favor of this practice and that more people should do it.

However, despite this, many of these activities do not contribute to the personal growth of young people and very few people spend their time reading a book, going to a museum, watching a cult movie, setting up a business idea or any other type of activity that allows you to meet new ideas, acquire different knowledge, learn a new language among many other activities that can be very interesting and can help young people to grow and improve themselves.

But as we mentioned earlier, there are very few who do it, on the other hand, there are many people who use their free time for leisure and although it is necessary for the human being you can also use that free time in more interesting activities.
